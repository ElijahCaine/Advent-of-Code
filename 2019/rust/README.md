## Usage

To run a given day do something like this:

```sh
cargo run -- one ./one/input
cargo run -- two 1,0,0,0,99
```

This will run the last version of the puzzle, so if it's a two part puzzle this
will run the second part (since it usually builds upon the first part and I am
too lazy to make a sub-command for both parts).

To run automated tests for all solutions:

```sh
cargo test
```
